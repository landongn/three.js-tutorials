## Three.js for the rest of us

Are you a javascript developer who has a firm grasp of the language, but when it comes to working in 3d or in the canvas, you just don't really know what you're doing yet? Do you have a desire to learn more about 3d programming in general?

I do. And i've always thought the best way to learn is by teaching- helping people understand complicated ideas only serves to make your knowledge greater. 

So, with great inspiration and many thanks for mr.doob, Tony Parisi, and countless other people in the 3d world, I'll be doing a weekly series on three.js.  Along the way, I'll try to work out the proper way to structure, document, and interact with three.js in such a way that it works as a general graphical layer on top of whatever state and logic that goes on behind the scenes in straightforward, well documented, and modular javascript code.  

"Examples" will be broken out into concepts, dealing with specific things within the three.js world as it relates to 3d programming in javascript.  We'll start out simple with things like rendering a basic white block into a screen, and work out way up into a simple, playable game, using all that we learned along the way. 

I'll try to update this repo every wednesday with a new example. 

Want to contribute?  Shoot me a pull request and I'd be happy to include it, but make sure you follow the formatting and style guidelines of the first lesson as closely as your comfortable with.
